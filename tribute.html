    <strong>Biography</strong>
    <br><br><br>
    <br><br>
    Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in Reading, Pennsylvania, to Andrea (Finlay), <br>
     a one-time marketing executive, and Scott Kingsley Swift, a financial adviser. Her ancestry includes<br> 
     German and English, as well as some Scottish, Irish, Welsh and 1/16th Italian. She was named after James Taylor, <br>
       and her mother believed that if she had a gender neutral name it would help her forge a business career. <br>
        Taylor spent most of her childhood on an 11-acre Christmas tree farm in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. <br>
         When she was nine years old the family moved to Wyomissing, PA, where she attended West Reading Elementary Center<br>
          and Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School. Taylor spent her summers at her parents' vacation home at the Jersey shore.<br>
           Her first hobby was English horse riding. Her mother put her in a saddle when she was nine months old and Swift later competed<br>
            in horse shows.  At the age of nine she turned her attention to musical theatre and performed in Berks Youth Theatre Academy<br>
             productions of "Grease", "Annie", "Bye Bye Birdie" and "The Sound of Music". She traveled regularly to New York City<br>
              she became interested in country music. At age 11, after many attempts, Taylor won a local talent competition by<br>
    singing a rendition of LeAnn Rimes' "Big Deal", and was given the opportunity to appear as the opening act for Charlie Daniels <br>
     at a Strausstown amphitheater. This interest in country music isolated Swift from her middle school peers.</p>
